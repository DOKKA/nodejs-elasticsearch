====================

crappy nodejs elasticsearch app written in express with twitter bootsrap

I don't even know/care how to use twitter bootstrap (I'm a database guy) and I'm sure it can be improved.

This app demonstrates how to create an express app that can be used to search an elasticsearch instance.

It is really only useful as a reference to those interested in writing a front-end for elasticsearch in nodejs.

There is no authentication, and the UI is horrible, but that's not the point.
